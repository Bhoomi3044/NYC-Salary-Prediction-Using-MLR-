# NYC-Salary-Prediction-Using-MLR-
Used Multiple Linear Regression to predict employee salary based on features and built model.

## Problem Statement
The New York City Controller's Office maintains a database of the salary and benefits paid to city employees since the financial year 2015. This is data representing the employee reimbursement report.
